# Generating Mock Files Using Mockery
## Introduction
This document explains how the mock files for our Go application were generated using the `mockery` tool. It provides the commands used and addresses whether this task is a unique occurrence or a recurring one. It also formalizes the commands for future reference.

## Overview of Mockery
Mockery is a tool used to automatically generate mock implementations of interfaces in Go. These mocks are typically used in unit tests to simulate the behavior of real objects and isolate the functionality being tested.

## Commands Used to Generate Mock Files
The following commands were used to generate the mock files for different packages in our Go application. Each command navigates to a specific directory and then uses `mockery` to generate mock files for all interfaces in that directory.

### Command for `proxy/iface` Package
```
cd proxy/iface
mockery --all --output=../../mocks/proxy/iface --outpkg=mocks
```

* **Description:** Generates mock files for all interfaces in the `proxy/iface` package.
* **Output Directory:** `../../mocks/proxy/iface`
* **Output Package:** mocks

### Command for `otel` Package
```
cd otel
mockery --all --output=../mocks/otel --outpkg=mocks
```
* **Description:** Generates mock files for all interfaces in the `otel` package.
* **Output Directory:** `../mocks/otel`
* **Output Package:** mocks

### Command for `proxy` Package
```
cd proxy
mockery --all --output=../mocks/proxy --outpkg=mocks
```
* **Description:** Generates mock files for all interfaces in the `proxy` package.
* **Output Directory:** `../mocks/proxy`
* **Output Package:** mocks

### Command for `spanner` Package
```
cd spanner
mockery --all --output=../mocks/spanner --outpkg=mocks
```
* **Description:** Generates mock files for all interfaces in the `spanner` package.
* **Output Directory:** `../mocks/spanner`
* **Output Package:** mocks

## Frequency of Task
This task is generally a recurring task. Mock files should be regenerated whenever there are changes to the interfaces in the respective packages. It's advisable to review and regenerate mock files at regular intervals, such as once every six months, or whenever significant changes are made to the interfaces.

## Future Reference
For future reference, the commands provided above should be used to regenerate mock files. Ensure to navigate to the appropriate directories and execute the commands to maintain consistency in the structure and location of mock files.

## Conclusion
This document serves as a formal record of the commands used to generate mock files for our Go application using the mockery tool. By following the outlined commands and maintaining a regular schedule for regenerating mock files, we can ensure that our unit tests remain up-to-date and effective.
